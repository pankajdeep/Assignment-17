       <h2>1. Compact Car: Toyota Corolla</h2>
       <center><img src="https://article.images.consumerreports.org/prod/content/dam/CRO%20Images%202018/Magazine/04April/CRM-Cars-inline-TopTen-Toyota-Corolla-2018-4-18" alt="Toyota" width=320></center>
       <p>
         This practical, fuel-efficient sedan has all the virtues that small-car shoppers seek, backed by its strong reliability track record.<br>
		 Despite its compact proportions, the Corolla has a relatively roomy interior, with a spacious backseat. Handling is secure, and the ride quality is a cut above for its class.<br>
		 The ho-hum engine with middling power won’t excite drivers, but the trade-off is stellar fuel economy of 32 mpg overall.<br><br>
		 <b>Price as tested: $20,652</b><br>

        <h2>2. Compact Green Car: Chevrolet Bolt</h2>
        <center><img src="https://article.images.consumerreports.org/prod/content/dam/CRO%20Images%202018/Magazine/04April/CRM-Cars-inline-TopTen-Chevrolet-Bolt-2018-4-18" alt="Chevrolet" width=320></center>
        <p>
		The Bolt proves that electric cars need not apologize for a lack of driving performance.<br>
		This distinctive-looking hatchback delivers brisk acceleration and tight handling, plus a 250-mile electric range at a mainstream price (when tax incentives are factored in).<br>
		This pure electric is built around a 60-kWh battery pack that holds a generous charge, reducing anxiety that you’ll run out of power and be stranded.<br>
		The driver sits high up in the Bolt, with a commanding view on a par with a small SUV.<br><br>
		<b>Price as tested: $43,155</b><br>

        <h2>3. Luxury Compact Car: Audi A4</h2>
        <center><img src="https://article.images.consumerreports.org/prod/content/dam/CRO%20Images%202018/Magazine/04April/CRM-Cars-Inline-TopTen-Audi-A4-2018-4-18" alt="Audi" width=320></center>
       <p>
         The A4 shines by being sporty, luxurious, and polished in a segment populated by superstars.<br>
		 It’s very satisfying to drive, with nimble, secure handling helped by its minimal body roll and responsive steering.<br>
		 The controlled ride is on the firm side, but proves steady and absorbent.<br>
		 The powerful turbocharged four-cylinder engine accelerates with gusto, proving ever-eager to make a quick getaway, yet doesn’t hurt your wallet at the pump.<br><br>
		 <b>Price as tested: $48,890</b><br>
